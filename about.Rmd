  *Motivation and Experience*
---
## Motivation ##
I decided to do this project mainly because is good creating a identitcal project that is the same as Preceptor's demo, it's good for trained of thoughts and stuck the skills and knowledge into my head. and ofcourse it's pretty **Cool**.

## Experience ##
This is the first official websites I created after the distill tutorials which is pretty cool, I like to learn in class rather than doing the tutoials but we have to do it unless we going to be kick out. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
